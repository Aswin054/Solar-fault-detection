z1. Downloadable Report (PDF/CSV)
Single upload: After prediction, allow users to download a small report (PDF) with the image, fault type, confidence, and recommendation.

Batch upload: Generate a CSV or ZIP of PDFs for all results.

Tech: jspdf, html2canvas, or server-side PDF generation using Python libraries (reportlab, weasyprint)

ðŸŒŸ 2. Image Annotation / Mark Detected Fault
Overlay bounding boxes or highlight areas where the model "sees" the fault in the image.

Tech: If your backend returns coordinates (bounding box), use canvas or CSS overlays to mark areas.

ðŸŒŸ 3. Save Analysis History (LocalStorage or MongoDB)
Keep a local history of uploaded images and their results for the session.

Or let users log in and save analysis in MongoDB with timestamps.

ðŸŒŸ 4. Progress Bar for Batch Upload
Right now, it's "Processing batch...", but a dynamic progress bar while predicting each image makes it feel alive.

Tech: Use async loop in frontend + progress bar component with percentage updates.

ðŸŒŸ 5. Dark Mode Toggle ðŸŒ™
A simple but effective UI feature to make your app feel modern.

Tech: Add a dark mode CSS class and toggle button. Save preference in localStorage.

ðŸŒŸ 6. Voice Assistant / Text-to-Speech
Let the app speak out the fault and recommendation.

Tech: Use browserâ€™s speechSynthesis API.

ðŸŒŸ 7. Confidence Graph (Chart)
For batch images, show a small bar chart or pie chart of status results: normal/warning/danger.

Tech: Use Chart.js or Recharts.

ðŸŒŸ 8. User Authentication (Optional)
Allow users to sign up/login to access past predictions or save frequent uploads.

Tech: Firebase Auth or JWT + MongoDB

ðŸŒŸ 9. Image Preprocessing Preview
Show original vs. preprocessed (grayscale, cropped, etc.) image before submitting to model.

Tech: Client-side image manipulation with canvas or server-side transformation
